# ABSTRACT: A modern bcrypt implementation

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Crypt::Bcrypt qw/bcrypt bcrypt_check/;

 my $hash = bcrypt($password, '2b', 12, $salt);

 if (bcrypt_check($password, $hash)) {
    ...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a modern and user-friendly implementation of the bcrypt password hash.

Note that in bcrypt passwords may only contain 72 characters. It may seem tempting to prehash the password before bcrypting it but that may make it vulnerable to password shucking, a salted solution (for example using a MAC) should be used instead if one wants to support large passwords.

=func bcrypt($password, $subtype, $cost, $salt)

This computes the bcrypt hash for C<$password> in C<$subtype>, with C<$cost> and C<$salt>.

Valid subtypes are:

=over 4

=item * C<2b>

This is the subtype the rest of the world has been using since 2014, you should use this unless you have a very specific reason to use something else.

=item * C<2a>

This is an old and subtly buggy version of bcrypt. This is mainly useful for Crypt::Eksblowfish compatibility.

=item * C<2y>

This type is considered equivalent to C<2b>, and is only commonly used on php.

=item * C<2x>

This is a very broken version that is only useful for compatibility with ancient php versions.

=back

C<$cost> must be between 5 and 31 (inclusive). C<$salt> must be exactly 16 bytes.

=func bcrypt_check($password, $hash)

This checks if the C<$password> satisfies the C<$hash>, and does so in a timing-safe manner.

=over 4

=item * L<Crypt::Passphrase|Crypt::Passphrase>

This is usually a better approach to managing your passwords, it can use this module via L<Crypt::Passphrase::Bcrypt|Crypt::Passphrase::Bcrypt>. It adds support for automatic pre-hashing, and facilitates upgrading the algorithm parameters or even the algorithm itself.

=item * L<Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt|Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt>

This also offers bcrypt, but only supports the C<2a> subtype.
